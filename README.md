### Introduction ###
DALL-E (mini|mega) models can be used to generate images based on text prompts. 
As the model developers wrote in the project report about DALL·E mini, “OpenAI had the first impressive model for generating images with DALL·E. DALL·E mini is an attempt at reproducing those results with an open-source model.”
